Then within the Guatemala department there is the largest municipality Guatemala City. The most populated area, according to cencus data, within Guatemala City is Villa Nueva. Above are the maps of Villa Nueva and Guatemala City with thier populations generated by random foresting.


## Population of Guatemala

### The Population by department
![](adm1_map_bar.png)

As illustrated by the map and bar graph the Guatemala department is by far the most populated area. The northern part of Guatemala is the least populated area. The northern area is mostly used for farming or mining. 

### Population by municipality

The most populated area in the Guatemala department is Guatemala City.

### 3D representation of population by department

When generating the population using data such as amount of water, topography, ect. My most accurate model came from my summed data. I know this because it had the smallest range of error. The error for my summed data was 8120344, mean was 9344418, logpop was 8188914, and random foresting was 928638. All of the data was similar, but the summed data was slightly more accurate.

When using satalite data to determine population, I looked at the relationship between some variables and their relationship to the population.

## Urban Populations
By using random foresting I was able to determine which areas had the highest density. The areas with a higher density can be assumed to be more urban. I Found the urban areas in Guatemala City for Zone 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 18.
